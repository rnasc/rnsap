# RnSap - SAP RFC 
Most the time, when needing to make SAP RFC calls, we need some simple functions:
- Read a Table
- Commit Work
- Do Goods Movement
- Create Purchase Order
- Post Finance Document

This Gem's simplifies that process, making it simple to get information back from SAP
into Ruby/Rails apps.
